<p><b>okay, kid im done.</b> i doubt you even have basic knowlege of hacking.<br>
    i dual boot linux so i can run my scripts. you made a big mistake of replying to my comment without using a proxy, because i'm already tracking youre ip. <br>
    since ur so hacking iliterate, that means internet protocol. once i find your ip i can easily install a backdoor trojan into your pc, not to mention your email will be in my hands.<br>
    dont even bother turning off your pc, because i can rout malware into your power system so i can turn your excuse of a computer on at any time.<br>
    it might be a good time to cancel your credit card since ill have that too.<br>
    if i wanted i could release your home information onto my secure irc chat and maybe if your unlucky someone will come knocking at your door. <br>
    id highly suggest you take your little comment about me back since i am no script kiddie. <br>
    i know java and c++ fluently and make my own scripts and source code. because im a nice guy ill give you a chance to take it back.<br>
    you have 4 hours in unix time, clock is ticking. ill let you know when the time is up by sending you an email to [redacted] which I aquired with a java program i just wrote. <br>
    see you then :)</p>
